# React-Storybook-Api

A single line off from [elderfo](https://github.com/elderfo)'s story loading tool. Because I couldn't exclude `node_modules` good with globs.

But actually, it's a CLI for dynamically importing stories into [Storybook for React Native](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react-native/).

#### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "awesome-project",
  "scripts": {
    "prestorybook": "rnstl"
  },
  "config": {
    "react-native-storybook-loader": {
      "searchDir": ["./src", "./packages"],
      "pattern": "**/*.stories.js",
      "outputFile": "./storybook/storyLoader.js"
    }
  }
}
```

## Story Loader API

A story loader is the file generated by `rnstl` used to load story files from your project in to Storybook. 

## Story Loader Formatting

To ensure the formatting of your story loader is on par with the rest of your code base, `rnstl` uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the generated story loaders. It will travese up the tree looking for a [Prettier configuration file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html). If none is found, the defaul Prettier settings will be used.
